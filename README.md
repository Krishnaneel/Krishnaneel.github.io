This repository contains a web application that allows users to add and display information about employees. To run the application, you can download or clone the entire repository and then run the index.html file with a web server such as Apache or Nginx. Alternatively, you can open the file in any Chromium-based browser.

The code follows best coding practices and file structures. Input fields in the form have been checked and validated thoroughly to avoid any bugs, wronf inputs or issues from the user end. However, Screen 3, which involves a pop-up to display information, has not been implemented, as it provides no new information, and Google discourages the usage of pop-ups.

To use the application, follow the instructions on the screen and fill in the necessary details. The employee details will be displayed in a table, and you can sort them using the "Sort" button with respect to the name.

Overall, this is a well-designed and tested application that meets the requirements stated in the Problem Statement.
